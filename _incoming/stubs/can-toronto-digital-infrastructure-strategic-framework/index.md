## Overview

The Toronto Digital Infrastructure Strategic Framework (DISF), approved by City Council in April 2022, is a corporate-wide initiative that establishes a principles-based approach to decision-making associated with digital infrastructure in Toronto. The framework applies to all new City Digital Infrastructure Initiatives, whether developed in-house, operated on behalf of the City, or undertaken in collaboration with third parties.
