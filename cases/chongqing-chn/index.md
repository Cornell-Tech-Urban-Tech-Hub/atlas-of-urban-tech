## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. -->
**Special Funds**. Multi-level departments of the city are advised to establish special funds to support and promote the digital technology innovation, data governance, and related work of the big data developement. One example of the special funds is named the "2023 Chongqing City Digital Economy Industry Development Special Fund Project", involving any sectors of software developement, information services, artificial intelligence, advanced computing, blockchain, and data governance. The applicant are required to be a company registered in Chongqing. 

**Collaboration with financial institutions**. Financial institutions are encouraged to expand and innovate their services and financial products for entities in the data factor market. Government of Yuzhong District plans to expand the financing channels for digital economy. Banks are guided to accelerate the establshment of the "Yu Zhong Rong" platform and acheive intelligent matching between the financing needs of digital economy enterprises and financial institutions's derivative products. 

**Special Financial Policy** 
Meanwhile, government of Liangjiang District announced a policy in 2023, "The Chongqing Liangjiang District Special Policy to Promote the High-Quality Development of Software and Information Services Industry" to provide special financial assistances for targeted entities. One point is that it will offer a maximum of 3 million RMB financial support to encourage large and medium-sized enterprises to accommodate innovations in software and information-related businesses". Another point is that companies selected into the list of "nationally key software companies" will receive a reward of 2 million RMB. There are also special policies focusing on absorbing more talent to promote the city data plan. 


## Outcomes
<!-- Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. About 50 words per is minimum, but these can be as long as you want/need. -->

**Integrated urban big data resource center project**. This project consists of three essential components: City Big Data Resource Center, City Information Model, "Mountain City Chain" Construction Program. The center will upgrade the government data sharing and exchange system and the public data sharing system, refining easy search, statistical analysis, application display and other useful functions for the sake of citizens. The CIM, which centers around the three-dimensional spatial data of the city, will integrate infrastructure data, such as buildings and railways, with relvant construction an resource databases to form an open and collaborative data resource system. Moreover, the program will build a modular and multi-layered blockchain public service platform,merging with the smart city's intelligent hub and providing blockchain development framework and resources to governments and enterprises via cloud services. 

**Data fusion application project**.  This project aims to enable "One Network Management, Service, Dispatch, and Governance" for citizens. More detailedly, this project will build a comprehensive urban management database for real-time decision-making and operational guidance and upgrade the "Chongqing Fast Service" government platform for more convenient public services, altogetherly improving the risk monitoring and disaster prevention ability of governments. Besdies, "Smart supervision, traffic, medical, and agriculture" is another important aspect of this project, covering multiple facets of citizens' daily life, such as traceable market regulatory processes, public traffic management system, digitalization of personal healthcare data and services, and agricultural analysis for farmers. 

**Data circulation expansion project**. "National Data Cyber Range" and "National Transaction Services Center" will be two major results of the project. The data cyber range refers to construct a vast library of general-purpose big data algorithms and component libraries, involving functionalities such as natural language processing, image analysis, and data mining. To better prepare for emergent events, such as public health crises and natural disaster, regular exersises utilizing those data libraries will be conducted. Another center points to the "Western Data Transaction Center", an platform providing a comprehensive set of services about data transactions among governments, enterprises, and social entities, targeting to standardize and encourage the transactions in the data factor market. 

## Open Questions
<!-- Identify 1-3 open question(s). What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? These can be 50 words or less. -->

**Public Communication**. Based on current case study, Chongqing seems to lack of a unified online official platform which can display current progress and present real-time news. This would help citizens and interested entities to have a more accurate understanding of Chongqing's smart city construction progress.  

**District-level Collaboration**. How do different districts collaborate on this data governance plan? Many of their regional plans are overlapping and there exist many collaborations among entities in various districts. 

**University Role**. What role does Chongqing University play during this construction process? Since Chongqing University is the best university of the city and is renowned for its urban planning and architecture discipline, I anticipate it to have more involvement in the data governance plan and the overall smart city project.
