## Financing
<!--  How are the technology interventions identified to be financed? How does this fit into financing of the larger project? Identify at least one financing mechanism that is being used. -->

**Financing Scheme**.  Technology interventions are identified and prioritized based on their potential to contribute to the project's overall goals of fostering innovation, economic growth, and sustainable urban development. The selection process involves close collaboration between the joint venture company, GKC Co., and various stakeholders, including government agencies, research institutions, and industry partners. Once a technology intervention is deemed strategically important, it is integrated into the master plan and budget of the larger project. For instance, the development of the comprehensive smart city infrastructure, which includes intelligent urban management systems, renewable energy solutions, and advanced ICT networks, is financed through a combination of government investments, private sector partnerships, and revenue generated from the project itself. One specific financing mechanism used in SSGKC is the public-private partnership (PPP) model, where the government provides land, infrastructure, and policy support, while private sector partners contribute capital, expertise, and market access. This approach allows for the sharing of risks and rewards, and ensures the financial sustainability of the technology interventions over the long term.

**Talent Attraction and Population Growth**. The Sino-Singapore International Joint Research Institute, established in 2015  between the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City Administrative Committee, South China University of Technology, Nanyang Technological University, and others, has emerged as a catalyst for Guangzhou's innovation-driven growth and talent attraction over the past five years. Bringing in over 200 high-tech professionals, including more than 30 from Singapore, the institute focuses on pioneering R&D across six cutting-edge platforms - life and health, new materials, AI, new energy, environmental solutions, and smart cities. It has since catalyzed over 45 industrial projects (25 in cooperation with partner universities), 40 patent applications, 44 new products and processes commercialized, and 88 published research papers. By leveraging Singapore's expertise, the institute implemented mechanisms facilitating worldwide tech transfer and IP protection for companies. The institute's contributions have been pivotal to the rapid growth witnessed in Guangzhou's Knowledge City, which currently has a permanent population exceeding 130,000 within its 232 square kilometer area. As of 2023, Knowledge City has attracted over 400 enterprises, 1,300 high-level talents, 4,000+ postgraduate students, and 30,000+ university students driving innovation, entrepreneurship and employment. Remarkably, the growth rates of the permanent population, workforce, and university student population have all surpassed 50% since the project's inception, with the student population increasing by around 72%.

**Ecological and Livable Environment**.  The Knowledge City has earned the National Three-Star Green Eco-City Certification,for its excellent urban ecological planning and abundance of green spaces integrated throughout the city. Not only focused on environmental sustainability, the development has has also prioritized accessible healthcare by constructing two state-of-the-art tertiary hospitals to provide high-quality medical resources for its residents. Moreover, the city boasts an efficient "five horizontal and five vertical" road network pattern complemented by ambitious infrastructure plans. These include the construction of 8 rail transit lines, 7 expressways, and 7 urban rapid roads - a comprehensive transportation network that will enable residents to reach major cities within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area in just one hour's travel time.

**A Smart living Demonstration Zone**.  Guangzhou Knowledge City exemplifies cutting-edge smart city living, seamlessly blending autonomous transportation and intelligent e-government services. The city has launched its first self-driving public transit line, with driverless vehicles powered by 5G, vehicle-road coordination, and AI technologies effortlessly navigating routes, yielding to traffic, and transporting passengers. Companies like Guangzhou Bus Group have deployed fleets of autonomous micro-circulating buses that operate around the clock in all scenarios. Beyond mobility, Knowledge City is pioneering smart e-government, leveraging advanced technologies to streamline public services and administration. Residents can access a comprehensive suite of government services online or via smart kiosks, benefiting from efficient digital workflows and data integration across municipal departments. This smart living demonstration zone provides a glimpse into the future of urban living, where autonomous mobility combines with seamless e-governance to create a more convenient, sustainable, and tech-enabled civic experience.
