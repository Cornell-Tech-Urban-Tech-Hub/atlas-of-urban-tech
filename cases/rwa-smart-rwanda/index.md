## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Smart Rwanda 2020 Master Plan is a framework aimed at transforming Rwanda into a knowledge-based economy and positioning the country as Africa's Information & Communications Technology (ICT) hub. It builds upon previous NICI plans and the ICT Sector Strategic Plan, aligning with national development visions and strategies; the plan contains a Rwanda Smart City Action Plan. The plan identifies three key enablers: ICT capability and capacity, governance and management, and secured and shared infrastructure. It focuses on seven pillars: smart agriculture, finance, trade and industry, health, education, government, and women and youth empowerment in ICT. With an expected investment of over \$500 million across 67 priority projects, the plan aimed to increase ICT's contribution to GDP from 3% to 5% and create 100,000 new jobs by 2020, driving productivity and expanding Rwanda's export base.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- What is the project trying to achieve? Identify 3-5 high-level goals that define the entire project.Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. -->

**Establish Rwanda as Africa's ICT Hub**. Develop world-class ICT infrastructure, attracting and nurturing ICT companies, startups, and talent, and positioning Kigali as a regional hub for ICT events and innovation centers. This aligns with the goal of transforming Rwanda into a leading destination for ICT in Africa. [1]

Significant efforts have been made in internet access, with 4G LTE expected to reach 95% of the country by end of 2017 through a public-private partnership. Mobile penetration is 70-80%, and 31% use digital services. ICTs are increasingly used for utility services like online billing and prepaid cards. [1]

**Transform into a Knowledge-Based Economy with usable real-time information**. Integrate ICT into key economic sectors, promote e-commerce and digital platforms, and develop smart city solutions. By leveraging technology to drive efficiency and productivity across various industries, Rwanda aims to transition from an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-driven one. [1]

While Rwanda has made strides in extending basic education access, challenges remain in rural areas, for the urban/rural poor, and those with disabilities/special needs. ICT plays a key role in increasing access through initiatives like 'One Laptop per Child'. However, with low secondary (28%) and tertiary (8%) enrollment rates, heavy investment is needed to expand infrastructure, teachers, and materials.

The University of Rwanda's establishment in 2013 consolidated quality education, but improving labor market relevance is a key challenge. The education sector must provide competencies and skills for accessing jobs, creating employment, and seizing business opportunities. Over 60% skills deficit exists in priority sectors.

This goal also aims to increase access to ICT education and training programs, providing support for women-led and youth-led ICT initiatives, and promoting gender equality and youth inclusion in the ICT workforce. This goal recognizes the importance of harnessing the potential of these groups in driving Rwanda's ICT development. [1]

**Mobility & Accessibility to Urban Services**. Rwanda faces increasing transportation demand from rapid urbanization, but its hilly terrain limits infrastructure expansion without high costs. Many urban areas already have poor connectivity. The sprawling nature of some cities requires significant investments for proper connectivity. As a landlocked country reliant on road transport and imported fuel, high transportation costs hinder economic competitiveness. A major challenge is sustainably increasing current infrastructure capacity to enable multimodal transport solutions, especially non-motorized modes, to improve connectivity while managing costs and promoting sustainable mobility.

Specifically, a company called the AC Group (started in 2015) has made the following contributions [11]:

- Introduced the Tap&Go card system for automated fare collection in public buses across Kigali and Rwanda. This system has facilitated over 298 million journeys and has over 3 million card holders
- Enabled bus companies to recover 30-40% of their revenues that were previously lost through cash-based fare collection
- Provided smart transport solutions like fleet monitoring systems and optimized payment systems for over 20 bus companies in Rwanda

However, the AC Group has faced challenges with interoperability, as their Tap&Go card system is not fully compatible with the systems of competitors like Centrika, leading to a feud over market dominance and customer choice. Despite directives from President Kagame to enforce interoperability, the issue remains unresolved, with allegations that AC Group has undermined these directives to maintain their market share. This highlights a challenge for the government in regulating development and maintaining control over the pace of progress when relying primarily on a Public-Private Partnership model in Rwanda. [12]

Furthermore, the government's annual report for 2021-2022 noted that AC Group and Centrika had successfully integrated their systems, allowing passengers to use any cards. However, this appears to contradict the more recent reports of ongoing interoperability issues. [5] This raises a concern on the credibility of the already limited government updates.

**Enhance Service Delivery and Governance**. Implement e-government services, establishing digital platforms for citizen engagement, and leveraging data analytics for evidence-based policymaking. These initiatives aim to improve transparency, efficiency, and citizen participation in governance processes.

**Drive Economic Growth and Job Creation**. The plan states that the urban population in Rwanda is expected to double in less than 20 years' time. Recognizing the urban density, potential resource constraint, but also opportunity for talent, the plan aims to attract foreign direct investment in the ICT sector in order to develop a skilled ICT workforce. By creating a conducive environment for ICT-driven businesses and nurturing talent, Rwanda aims to boost its economic growth and create new employment opportunities. The master plan also acknoeldges that Rwanda needs to create "enabling regulation" to support the stated aspirations.

For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities in digital master plans (development, engagement, implementation). For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of innovation hubs?
-->

**Comprehensive Situational Assessment**. The plan involved a comprehensive assessment of the existing situation, including a review of the Kigali Innovation City (KIC) master plan, stakeholder interviews, and an examination of six functional areas (mobility, energy, water, buildings, facilities management, and community engagement). This assessment helped identify the current state, challenges, and opportunities for smart city development in Rwanda.

**Technical, Regulatory, and Environmental Analyses**.  The plan called for conducting technical analyses to assess the feasibility, costs, and requirements for implementing smart city technologies and infrastructure. Additionally, regulatory analyses were conducted to review existing policies, laws, and regulations related to ICT, urban development, and smart city initiatives. Furthermore, a preliminary environmental and social impact assessment was carried out to ensure the sustainability and inclusivity of the proposed smart city projects.

**Roadmap and Investment Plan**. The plan involved developing a comprehensive roadmap and investment plan to operationalize smart city solutions over a ten-year period (2016-2020). This roadmap outlined specific activities, timelines, and resources required for the implementation of the Smart Rwanda Master Plan, including 67 priority projects across various sectors with an expected investment of over \$500 million.

**Alignment with National Strategies and Policies**. The Smart Rwanda Master Plan is closely aligned with Rwanda's national development visions, strategies, and policies, such as the Vision 2020, the National Strategy for Transformation (NST-1), and the ICT Sector Strategic Plan (ICT SSP). This alignment ensures that the plan's activities and initiatives are consistent with the country's overall development goals and priorities.

**Kigali Innovation City Testbed**. Kigali Innovation City is an urban district that provides an enabling environment for testing new technologies and innovations related to smart cities. It aims to facilitate activities like:

- Beta-testing of urban technologies and solutions in a controlled environment Making urban data openly available to companies and innovators
- Hosting challenge-based innovation contests and hackathons to develop low-cost solutions to urban challenges

Rwanda has the highest population density in Africa, where ~16.52% of the population lives in urban areas and almost half is concentrated in Kigali, with a population of ~1.1 million residents. A key challenge is that any technology solution deployed needs to be scalable and accessible to be truly useful for the residents. [1]

**E-Government Services**. The plan aims to implement e-government services for citizen services, document management, and public administration. This includes the development of digital platforms for citizen engagement, feedback, and participatory decision-making processes. The plan also emphasizes the use of data analytics and decision support systems for evidence-based policymaking and resource allocation.

**Smart City Solutions**. The plan emphasizes the development of smart city solutions to enhance urban planning, transportation, energy management, and environmental sustainability. This includes the implementation of intelligent transportation systems, smart grids, and smart buildings. The plan also highlights the importance of leveraging data and analytics for evidence-based decision-making in urban management.

**Tap&Go**. Tap&Go Smart Payment System is an automated fare collection system implemented for public transportation in Kigali, Rwanda. The system leverages 4G LTE connectivity to enable seamless and efficient fare collection. The Tap&Go cards and bus card readers are connected to a central system over 4G LTE networks, enabling real-time transaction processing, fare calculation, and data collection across the entire public transportation network in Kigali.

Key features and benefits of the Tap&Go 4G LTE-enabled system include:

- Cashless payments: Commuters no longer need to carry cash, reducing risks associated with handling cash on buses.
  Convenience: Tap&Go cards can be reloaded instantly at agent locations or through mobile money platforms like MTN Mobile Money.
- Interoperability: The Tap&Go card can be used across all bus companies operating in Kigali and for upcountry travel.
- Revenue protection: Bus operators receive all fare revenues electronically, reducing leakages from cash handling. The system also provides electronic sales records for better accounting.

- Scalability: The 4G LTE infrastructure allows for seamless integration of additional features, such as mobile ticketing apps, journey planning, and other smart mobility services.

The Tap&Go system has been widely adopted, facilitating over 298 million journeys and covering 100% of Kigali's public transportation network. [11]

**Healthcare Drone Delivery**. The Government of Rwanda partnered with the US-based startup Zipline to launch a pioneering drone delivery service for medical supplies across the country in 2016. This initiative, known as the National Drone Service, aimed to improve access to essential medical products, particularly in remote and hard-to-reach areas.

Under this partnership, Zipline established distribution centers in Rwanda, from where their drones could deliver blood, medicines, and vaccines to hospitals and health centers within a radius of up to 80 kilometers (50 miles). The drones are designed to fly autonomously, guided by GPS and remote operators, and can carry payloads of up to 1.8 kilograms.

This innovative drone delivery system has significantly reduced the time required to transport medical supplies, especially in emergencies. Instead of waiting hours or days for ground transportation, critical items like blood, vaccines, and life-saving medications can now be delivered within 30 minutes or less.

The National Drone Service has been a game-changer for Rwanda's healthcare system, improving access to essential medical products and saving lives. As of 2021, Zipline had made over 200,000 deliveries to more than 1,000 health facilities across the country, covering a population of over 11 million people.

The success of this partnership has inspired other countries to explore similar drone delivery services for healthcare and has positioned Rwanda as a leader in leveraging innovative technologies to improve public services and infrastructure.

**E-Policing**. Rwanda has implemented a comprehensive e-policing strategy that leverages technology to enhance public safety, law enforcement, and traffic management. One of the key components of this strategy is an extensive network of CCTV cameras installed across public areas and major roads in Kigali. These cameras are connected to a central command center operated by the Rwanda National Police (RNP), allowing for real-time monitoring of traffic, people's movements, and potential security threats or violations. The CCTV footage aids in crime prevention, detection, and investigation efforts by law enforcement.

In addition to the CCTV surveillance system, Rwanda has introduced an online platform for the registration and renewal of driving licenses. This digital service aims to streamline the process and improve efficiency in the issuance of driving licenses, aligning with the broader e-policing strategy. The strategy also involves leveraging social media platforms, likely for disseminating information, receiving reports or alerts from citizens, and coordinating first responder efforts during emergencies or incidents.

Furthermore, Rwanda has implemented the use of speed governors in vehicles as a measure to minimize road accidents. These electronic devices limit the maximum speed a vehicle can attain, preventing excessive speeding and contributing to improved road safety through technology interventions.

The e-policing services and strategies outlined above demonstrate Rwanda's commitment to leveraging technology for enhancing public safety, law enforcement, and traffic management. By integrating CCTV surveillance, digital services, social media, and speed control measures, the Rwandan government aims to create a more efficient, responsive, and data-driven policing system.

However, it's important to note that while these initiatives can improve security and service delivery, they also raise concerns about privacy, data protection, and the potential for misuse or overreach.

As of April 2024, the Rwandan Police are being supported by the Punjab Police in Lahore in areas of traffic management, infrastructure development and achieving efficiency in public service delivery. [3]

**IremboGov**. IremboGov is Rwanda's flagship e-government portal that enables citizens and businesses to access a wide range of government services online. It was built through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the Government of Rwanda and RwandaOnline Platform Ltd., a private company, which seems to have renamed itself to Irembo. Irembo has a 25-year agreement with the Rwandan government to work with government agencies to digitize and maintain public services on a single window platform (IremboGov).

Launched in 2014, IremboGov aims to make government services faster, more convenient, and less costly for citizens. The online platform currently provides access to 73 services in areas of Family, Immigration & Emigration, Identification, Land, Police, Notarisation & Gazette Service, Health, Education, Rwanda Museums, Transport, Criminal Record, Media, Rwanda Investigation Bureau, and Trade & Industry. [16]

Citizens can access Irembo services through the internet, either on their personal devices or at designated internet cafes and agents. There are over 1,500 internet cafes and agents hired by Irembo to assist users who do not have internet access or digital literacy. Irembo also utilizes USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) technology to enable access through basic mobile phones for those without internet.

Irembo has streamlined the way government agencies operate by integrating ICT across the service delivery value chain .
It has increased transparency and accountability by leaving a digital trail for all transactions, reducing the potential for corruption. As of 2024, Irembo recorded a 30% growth in the number of transactions, reflecting increased citizen trust and adoption of the platform. The World Bank has recognized Rwanda's e-government systems, including Irembo, as a top performer on the Doing Business Index, making the country attractive for investors.

Irembo plans to launch mobile apps on Android and iOS platforms for improved accessibility. There are plans to open up the Irembo system to allow other developers to build additional services and integrations.

**ICT Integration in Key Economic Sectors**. The plan focuses on integrating ICT into key economic sectors such as agriculture, finance, trade, industry, health, and education to drive efficiency and productivity. This includes initiatives such as:

- Smart Agriculture: Precision farming, remote sensing, and agricultural information systems.
- FinTech: Digital payments, mobile banking, and financial inclusion solutions.
- Smart Health: Telemedicine, electronic health records, and health information systems.
- Smart Education: E-learning platforms, digital educational resources, and learning management systems.

One notable example of transforming Kigali into a smart city is the work undertaken by Inmarsat. In 2017, the company signed an agreement with the Rwandan government, championed by President Paul Kagame, to spearhead Kigali's smart city transformation. Inmarsat collaborated with Carnegie Mellon University, the African Centre of Excellence in IoT, the University of Rwanda, Fab Lab, and the Rwanda Integrated Polytechnic Regional Centre to deploy a Low Power Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) across the entire city. This deployment was carried out in partnership with Actility, a leading industry player in Low Power Wide Area Networks.

With the LoRaWAN connectivity infrastructure in place, data can now be seamlessly and securely transmitted from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors to an Inmarsat gateway, before being relayed to the broader internet via Inmarsat's satellite network. This data is then fed into analytics dashboards, providing project managers with valuable insights that drive innovation and enable the development of smart city solutions. [12]

**Cybersecurity and Data Protection**. The plan recognizes the importance of cybersecurity and data protection in the digital age. It aims to establish a secure and resilient cyberspace through research and development, as well as the implementation of a conducive policy, legal, and institutional framework. Additionally, the plan emphasizes the need for data protection measures to ensure the trusted and secure handling of personal data.

Several of the interventions, such as e-government services, smart city solutions, and the Tap&Go payment system, involve the collection, processing, and storage of personal data from citizens. This raises concerns about data privacy and the need for robust data protection regulations to safeguard individual privacy rights and prevent misuse of personal information. With the increasing reliance on digital platforms, systems, and networks, there is a heightened risk of cyber threats, such as hacking, data breaches, and cyber attacks. Comprehensive cybersecurity regulations and frameworks would be necessary to ensure the security and resilience of these technology interventions, particularly those handling sensitive data or critical infrastructure.

Many of the technology interventions, such as the Tap&Go payment system and IremboGov, involve public-private partnerships (PPPs). Robust regulations governing public procurement processes, PPP contracts, and the management of such partnerships would be crucial to ensure transparency, accountability, and value for money.

For instance, the Healthcare Drone Delivery initiative, while innovative, may face regulatory challenges related to aviation laws, airspace management, and safety protocols for drone operations. Clear regulations governing the use of drones for commercial and public service purposes would be required to ensure safe and responsible deployment.

## Open Questions

<!-- What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? Identify 1-3 open question(s). -->

**Sustainability & Long-Term Financing**. While the Smart Rwanda Master Plan outlines an ambitious vision and roadmap, the long-term sustainability and financing of the proposed initiatives remain uncertain. If charted, the progress made is not linear, rather logarithmic, given that a number of organizations and relevant laws passed were in 2020, 3 years after the plan was introduced, suggesting that with the roadmap and laws governing, there is a potential for increased development activity (i.e., Rwanda has chosen to build with guardrails rather than sell data/assets to rush development). However, the plan heavily relies on public-private partnerships and attracting foreign direct investment, but the specific mechanisms and incentives to ensure consistent and adequate funding over the long term are not clearly defined. Questions arise regarding the government's ability to maintain financial commitments and the private sector's willingness to invest in the face of potential risks or changing market conditions.

Rwanda, being a developing country, faces limitations in its ability to allocate substantial financial resources from the national budget towards the implementation of the Smart Rwanda Master Plan. The government's fiscal capacity is constrained by competing priorities, such as infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. This could potentially limit the government's ability to maintain consistent financial commitments to the plan over the long term.

The plan heavily relies on attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) and development assistance from international organizations and partners. However, FDI inflows can be volatile and influenced by global economic conditions, political stability, and investor confidence. A downturn in the global economy or shifts in investor sentiment could potentially impact the flow of FDI into Rwanda's ICT sector. Additionally, development assistance from international organizations and donor countries may be subject to geopolitical considerations, changing priorities, and budgetary constraints.

The success of the Smart Rwanda Master Plan is closely tied to regional cooperation and integration within the East African Community (EAC) and the broader African continent. Rwanda's ability to position itself as a regional ICT hub and attract investment may be influenced by geopolitical dynamics, trade relations, and the pace of regional integration efforts. Tensions or conflicts within the region could potentially disrupt cross-border collaboration, supply chains, and the free movement of goods, services, and talent, hampering the plan's implementation.

The Smart Rwanda 2020 Master Plan (published in 2015, prior to the Smart City Plan publication in 2017) was more detailed in listing the projects, expected finish date, and a listed budget, with responsible stakeholder. The Smart City Master Plan lacks this detail/planning as it is a framework and must be used in conjunction with a detailed plan, such as the ICT Sector Strategic Plan.

**Capacity Building and Talent Development**. The successful implementation of the Smart Rwanda Master Plan hinges on the availability of a skilled and capable workforce. However, the plan does not provide detailed strategies for developing the necessary human capital, particularly in emerging technologies and specialized domains. Questions remain about the effectiveness of existing education and training programs in meeting the future talent demands of a knowledge-based economy, and the measures needed to bridge potential skill gaps.

The country highlights a need and path to increase digital literacy but not how they will bridge the gap between digital literacy and skills - it would be interesting to see digital vocational training schemes linked towards their stated goals. I am concerned about how much ownership and control the government of Rwanda retains over critical digital infrastructure projects. Specifically, by engaging in a public-private partnership (PPP) where the private company Irembo lists itself as the owner of IremboGov (the main e-government platform of Rwanda), there is a risk of:

- The government losing sovereignty and control over core digital services and sensitive citizen data by ceding full ownership to a private entity.
- Setting a precedent where private profit motives could overshadow public interest objectives for such strategic national platforms.
- Creating vendor lock-in, limiting future flexibility and competitiveness in procuring e-government solutions.
- Potential brain drain of local tech talent from the public sector to these private companies managing core government systems.
  While PPPs can provide needed financing and expertise, I believe the government must retain sufficient ownership, oversight and control over transformative digital initiatives that are critical national priorities and handle sensitive data. Ceding full ownership to private vendors in such strategic assets poses risks to Rwanda's long-term digital sovereignty and alignment with the public interest.

**Regulatory and Policy Frameworks**. While the plan acknowledges the need for a conducive legal and regulatory environment, the specific policy reforms and regulatory frameworks required to support the envisioned digital transformation are not comprehensively addressed. Questions arise regarding the government's ability to keep pace with rapidly evolving technologies, address issues such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and intellectual property rights, and create a business-friendly environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship.

**ICT Strategy**. The master plan noted that it will be the ICT strategy from 2015 onwards (leading to Vision 2020 and beyond). There is no clear information available on how the Covid-19 pandemic affected the Rwandan government's ability to finance some of their projects (or if external sources of funding has slowed down, which is a fair assumption to make) and/or if priority areas have shifted. This could impact the feasability of their ICT strategy and whether their smart city master plan framework can still effectively guide their development (i.e., does there need to be an updated version that addresses present challenges).

## Significance for the broader Smart Cities Community

This master plan and initiative allows Rwanda to position itself as a regional leader in Smart City development and technology governance; the lessons learned in Rwanda can be applicable to other nations seeking to grow their ICT sector and enable smart city solutions in different sectors (e.g., e-government, health, education). Each African nation has its own set of challenges and constraints but there can be some common lessons.

The application of the framework in ongoing projects such as the Kigali Innovation City can serve as a (replicable) blueprint for other cities/nations for similar transformations. Rwanda is notably strong on collborating with international governments/companies, providing reassurance and safety for expedient yet safe growth of investent. As a direct result of the smart city master plan, the vision expressed, and needs identified, Rwanda has also forged strong relations with South Korea.

In October 2022, the Rwandan Minister of Infrastructure and the South Korean Vice Minister for Transport discussed promoting electric transport and green mobility options in Rwanda. They expressed commitment to forging strong partnerships, particularly in the deployment of e-buses in the city of Kigali, leveraging South Korea's advanced technologies in e-mobility. [15]

The exploration of diversified and sustainable financing mechanisms, such as public-private partnerships and innovative financing instruments, provides valuable lessons for other African nations seeking to fund similar initiatives. Rwanda experimenting with innovation funds can seek to inform other nations on the viability and resources required for success in their implementation.

Globally, this is an opportunity to re-assess the use of technology and how it is built from the ground-up at a low-cost and navigate the challenges of developing nations leapfrogging legacy infrastructure to embrace cutting-edge technologies like IoT and LoRaWAN.
