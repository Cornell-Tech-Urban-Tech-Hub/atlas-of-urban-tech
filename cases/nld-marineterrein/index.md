## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Marineterrein, situated in the heart of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is an emerging hub of innovation and urban development. A former military base, the area has become an exhilarating community that doubles as a living laboratory for urban technology and sustainability. As a shining example of a New Century City, the Marineterrein district contains several unique aspects that distinguish it from typical urban environments. This case study delves into how this innovation district in the centre of Amsterdam incorporates adaptability, sustainability, technological innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity as its guiding principles.

## Key Characteristics

<!-- Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper? -->

**Smart Infrastructure**. The Marineterrein employs smart infrastructure in numerous ways. The district showcases a smart mobility system that leverages shared electric vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrian walkways to promote sustainable transportation. Renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines are used to energize buildings and decrease carbon emissions.

**Community Engagement and Co-Creation**. During the summer, Amsterdam locals know the harbourside, fenced off by ships, as an idyllic swimming spot. On this publicly accessible yet privately owned terrain, they host numerous public events, workshops, and open houses. The district's co-creation platform, Marineterrein Community, invites residents and stakeholders to contribute their ideas and feedback on its growth and programming.

**Innovation and Entrepreneurship**. The district's Innovation Lab furnishes a collaborative workspace for entrepreneurs and innovators, including national and international startups. Meanwhile, the Marineterrein Living Lab provides a real-world testing environment for new concepts and products.

**Sustainability and Resilience**. Many buildings within the Marineterrein feature green roofs and rain gardens for stormwater management and for creating green spaces and biodiversity corridors to nurture local ecosystems. Some buildings, like the historic Kommandants (Commander) building, are over a hundred years old, showcasing the use of circular economy principles to minimize waste and encourage resource efficiency.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- Summarize the most important goals of the project. Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. The text should be around 50 words. -->

**Foster innovation and entrepreneurship** - The Marineterrein encourages startups, tech firms, and research institutions to pursue cutting-edge technologies and solutions for modern urban challenges. It offers spaces for innovation and available co-working spots to increase social interactions.

**Promote sustainability and resilience** - The district aims to boost sustainable and resilient practices via green infrastructure, practicing the principles of a circular economy, and using renewable energy sources.

**Promote community engagement and co-creation** - The area aims to interact with the community through various channels like public events, workshops, and open houses, while also co-creating solutions for urban challenges alongside residents and stakeholders.

**Implement smart infrastructure**- The district's goal is to employ smart infrastructure to cultivate more efficient, sustainable, and liveable urban environments by leveraging renewable energy sources, intelligent mobility systems, and data-driven solutions.

**Prioritize accessibility and inclusivity** - The Marrineterrein creates a barrier-free environment that is accessible and welcoming to all residents and visitors, irrespective of their backgrounds or abilities. This is achieved through participatory design processes, community programs, and accessible infrastructure and public spaces.

## Technology Interventions
<!-- Identify 3-5 specific technology-enabled interventions the project employs or proposes. The text should be around 75-125 words. Separate into more than 1 paragraph as needed. This is a good place to insert additional images, be sure to include captions identifying the source and make sure to not use copyrighted images. -->

**Roboat**.  
The Roboat project in Amsterdam brings forth the world's first fleet of autonomous boats, pioneering a revolution in urban water systems. The research scheme explores the potential of autonomous floating vessels in metropolitan regions, enabling dynamic infrastructure, transportation, and environmental sensing on Amsterdam's canals. With a full-scale prototype in progress, Roboat offers an inventive solution for waste collection and transport. Utilizing LiDAR technology, Roboat creates a comprehensive city picture from millions of data points for navigation and object identification. The joint effort between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), and local authorities has been met with significant support. Roboat's capabilities extend to temporary floating infrastructure and environmental exploration to enhance waste separation rates and contribute to sustainable urban practices. This project could have implications for water-based cities beyond Amsterdam, addressing the demand for efficient waste collection systems.

**Druktemeter (Crowdmeter)**. They are testing the Druktemeter, a system utilizing cameras and visitor screens to measure and map crowd density during the summer. The goal is to maintain a livable environment while respecting COVID-19 safety protocols. Cameras connected to a computer algorithm count visitors and generate data to enhance the quality of public spaces. Privacy is safeguarded as visitor identities are anonymized before analysis. The system offers real-time data to inform visitors about crowd density at different locations within the site. This experiment assesses crowd levels and livability at Marineterrein and investigates whether visitors adapt their behaviour and maintain physical distancing norms. The results of this test serve as a blueprint for future implementations of similar crowd management systems in urban areas.

**Respyre**
Respyre is determined to convert dull grey concrete into a green, cooling oasis. Using bioreceptive concrete, the project crafts healthy green facades that augment urban livability and boost local biodiversity. This innovative concrete variant lets moss attach and grow, gradually turning bare concrete walls into living surfaces covered in moss. This moss layer offers natural capital by cooling the environment, purifying the air, and offering a habitat for various flora and fauna. Moreover, it needs minimal maintenance and is cost-effective. Respyre's "proof of concept" explores the potential of bio-receptive concrete in fighting heat and pollution while assessing its positive impact on the livability of cities.

## Stakeholders
<!-- Identify 3-5 key stakeholder organizations or groups. The text should be around 50 words, and include a link to the organization.-->
