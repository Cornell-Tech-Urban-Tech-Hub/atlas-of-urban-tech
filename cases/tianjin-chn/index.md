## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Sino-Singapore Eco-City is a joint venture between Chinese and Singapore government. Since 2008, developing that district has been a high-priority mission of the Chinese government, taking great advantages real-estate investment favoring policies, and the effective implementation of a top-to-bottom planning strategy. The primary motivation behind the district is to experiment an alternative development model to the traditionally dense and pollution heavy city models in China. Green space and natural landscapes are the foundations of Eco-city, which is also the most attractive feature for new residents. It is friendly for new residents to move in, as it is only 30 kilometers away from Tianjin, and 150 kilometers away from Beijing. The city is also built upon the concept of modular neighborhood and 15-minutes comfort circle for everyone.


## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Mix use**.  A very important characteristic of new centry smart cities is the business, commercial, recreation, and residential mix-use of its spaces, this helps diverse and interesting lifestyle to emerge as it empowers residence with more connecticity in their everyday life. The Eco-Cell, Eco-Community, and Eco-District modular hierarchy convinient zone allows everybody to find essential services within their 15-minutes walking cell, and all means of recreation within their neighborhood.

**Promote sustainability**.  An important motivation of the Sino-Singapore Eco-City is to experiment with a city development mode that is nature-friendly, in contrast to other major Chinese cities. The city introduces a lot of dedicated green spaces not planned for future development, believing that those spaces not only mediates the carbon footprint of human life, but is also beneficial to resident's quality of life. The city also has a full coverage of public transportation in terms of streets, allowing residents to use public transportation in all occasions.

**Use advanced information and community-oriented technologies for efficient management of urban services**.  For a city to truly belong in the new century, it must be able to take advantage of technologies to efficiently manage its services. Residents of the Eco-City can access more than 95% of administrative public service from an app on their phone. In case of natural emergencies, the digitized utility maintainance and operation center pays close attention on the hard systems protecting the city in real time. This allows the managers of the city to make every decision with better awareness.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- Summarize the most important goals of the project. Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. The text should be around 50 words. -->

**Create a living space with tight connection to nature**:  No matter where a person is, they should be able to see plenty of vegetation. It must be convinient for everybody to fully submerge into the nature. 

**Co-exist with the nature under harmony**: The building process and operation of the city must maintain low environmental footprint. The city has advanced infrastructure that takes advantage from renewable sources of energy, advanced rain water usage, and requires all buildings to be carbon neutral green buildings. 

**Promote cultural growth**:  Promoting traditional, contemporary, and new culture. Making the entire city accessible by ensuring at least 20% of all housings are public affordable housing, and 100% barrier free entrance to all public areas.


## Technology Interventions
<!--  Identify 3-5 specific technology-enabled interventions the project employs or proposes. The text should be around 75-125 words. Separate into more than 1 paragraph as needed. This is a good place to insert additional images, be sure to include captions identifying the source and make sure to not use copyrighted images. --->

**Green oriented building design**: Extensive use of new recyclable construction material. Usage of Argon glass to improve insulation, optimizing building design and orientation to provide adjustable sunlight heating, seasonal variable natural ventilation, and natural light coverage. Integration of green walls with vegetation to naturally improve indoor air quality.

Building water usage is monitored, with rain-water harvesting and reuse system fully built in. Renewable energy collection system built in buildings. Water and power resources usage and recycling are monitored and controlled in a single platform.

**Pneumatic Waste Collection System**:  Residents are encouraged and rewarded to sort their waste. Pneumatic Waste Collection System allows waste to be sorted and transported in large scale, where the transportation to the centralized facility is an air-tight process. Recyclables are turned into products, and kitchen wastes are used as material for fertilizers and industrial soaps. Other wastes are turned harmless locally using chemical procedures, instead of being shipped out.

**Sponge City concept**:  Resillience against and efficient use of water is built within the foundation of the Eco-City. Permanent sensers were built into different stages of the tap water service pipelines, ensuring the water quality meets drinking standard from the facility to the tap. Effectively harvesting rainwater through real-time stormwater run-off control, water quality and volume citywide monitored and controlled in a single system. In case of storms, effectively prevent flooding from using permeable pavement, large natural landscape damping, the water harvesting system which stores rainwater partially for later use, and high-capacity run-off to ocean.
