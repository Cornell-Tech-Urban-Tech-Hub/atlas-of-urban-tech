## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Sino-Singapore Eco-City is a joint venture between Chinese and Singapore government. Since 2008, developing that district has been a high-priority mission of the Chinese government, taking great advantages real-estate investment favoring policies, and the effective implementation of a top-to-bottom planning strategy. The primary motivation behind the district is to experiment an alternative development model to the traditionally dense and pollution heavy city models in China. Green space and natural landscapes are the foundations of Eco-city, which is also the most attractive feature for new residents. It is friendly for new residents to move in, as it is only 30 kilometers away from Tianjin, and 150 kilometers away from Beijing. The city is also built upon the concept of modular neighborhood and 15-minutes comfort circle for everyone.


## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Mix use**.  A very important characteristic of new centry smart cities is the business, commercial, recreation, and residential mix-use of its spaces, this helps diverse and interesting lifestyle to emerge as it empowers residence with more connecticity in their everyday life. The Eco-Cell, Eco-Community, and Eco-District modular hierarchy convinient zone allows everybody to find essential services within their 15-minutes walking cell, and all means of recreation within their neighborhood.

**Promote sustainability**.  An important motivation of the Sino-Singapore Eco-City is to experiment with a city development mode that is nature-friendly, in contrast to other major Chinese cities. The city introduces a lot of dedicated green spaces not planned for future development, believing that those spaces not only mediates the carbon footprint of human life, but is also beneficial to resident's quality of life. The city also has a full coverage of public transportation in terms of streets, allowing residents to use public transportation in all occasions.

**Use advanced information and community-oriented technologies for efficient management of urban services**.  For a city to truly belong in the new century, it must be able to take advantage of technologies to efficiently manage its services. Residents of the Eco-City can access more than 95% of administrative public service from an app on their phone. In case of natural emergencies, the digitized utility maintainance and operation center pays close attention on the hard systems protecting the city in real time. This allows the managers of the city to make every decision with better awareness.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- Summarize the most important goals of the project. Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. The text should be around 50 words. -->

**Create a living space with tight connection to nature**:  No matter where a person is, they should be able to see plenty of vegetation. It must be convinient for everybody to fully submerge into the nature. 

**Co-exist with the nature under harmony**: The building process and operation of the city must maintain low environmental footprint. The city has advanced infrastructure that takes advantage from renewable sources of energy, advanced rain water usage, and requires all buildings to be carbon neutral green buildings. 

**Promote cultural growth**:  Promoting traditional, contemporary, and new culture. Making the entire city accessible by ensuring at least 20% of all housings are public affordable housing, and 100% barrier free entrance to all public areas.


## Technology Interventions
<!--  Identify 3-5 specific technology-enabled interventions the project employs or proposes. The text should be around 75-125 words. Separate into more than 1 paragraph as needed. This is a good place to insert additional images, be sure to include captions identifying the source and make sure to not use copyrighted images. --->

**Green oriented building design**: Extensive use of new recyclable construction material. Usage of Argon glass to improve insulation, optimizing building design and orientation to provide adjustable sunlight heating, seasonal variable natural ventilation, and natural light coverage. Integration of green walls with vegetation to naturally improve indoor air quality.

Building water usage is monitored, with rain-water harvesting and reuse system fully built in. Renewable energy collection system built in buildings. Water and power resources usage and recycling are monitored and controlled in a single platform.

**Pneumatic Waste Collection System**:  Residents are encouraged and rewarded to sort their waste. Pneumatic Waste Collection System allows waste to be sorted and transported in large scale, where the transportation to the centralized facility is an air-tight process. Recyclables are turned into products, and kitchen wastes are used as material for fertilizers and industrial soaps. Other wastes are turned harmless locally using chemical procedures, instead of being shipped out.

![Alt Text / Waste Management](./waste.jpg "Waste Management(Unsplash)")

**Sponge City concept**:  Resillience against and efficient use of water is built within the foundation of the Eco-City. Permanent sensers were built into different stages of the tap water service pipelines, ensuring the water quality meets drinking standard from the facility to the tap. Effectively harvesting rainwater through real-time stormwater run-off control, water quality and volume citywide monitored and controlled in a single system. In case of storms, effectively prevent flooding from using permeable pavement, large natural landscape damping, the water harvesting system which stores rainwater partially for later use, and high-capacity run-off to ocean.

## Leadership
<!--  Conduct one interview with a project leader, and link to a LinkedIn or other profile. Provide a brief biography, no more than 75 words. Identify 3-5 insights or themes from the interview. Feel free to add a photo of the individual here. --->

**Real-Estate Development On-Site Manager: Mr. Qi**. The unnamed field manager, Mr. Qi, works for [Jia Liu](http://www.tianjineco-city.com/About/team?lang=english/), who is the Deputy CEO of SSTEC. This project leader manages the on-site construction works in developing the Eco-City, he has witnessed the waves of people moving into the city, and how the city was built over the past 8 years. The opportunity to interview him came from our family relationship back in my home Beijing, which we share family members who are siblings. He wished to remain unidentified in my report, so that he could speak freely of what he truly thinks.

**Insight 1: Personal Car Usage**: Sustainability is among the most important values that builds the foundation of the Eco-City, and the city has invested in a public transportation system capable of taking people anywhere around town to implement sustainable, green travelling. However, more than 90% of residential families own at least one vehicle. Being an ecological city that is comfortable to live in, the Eco-City actually lacks attractiveness for medical and technology industries to settle in, as they have already built large sites at nearby locations: Beijing and Tianjin. Most families moved here to allow children and elderly parents to enjoy how nature surrounds, while the adults have to commute to Tianjin for work. A city prepared for car-free living now suffers ironic rush hours daily.

**Insight 2: Living Concepts & Legislation Conflict**: As a city that promotes cultural growth, the residential buildings and neighborhoods of the Eco-City features an abundance in public spaces. Introduced by Keppels Group, there are many benefits to having large areas of public space in residential areas, significantly improving the comfort level of residents. However, the apartments are sold under traditional Chinese real-estate law, by which the household purchased area stated on contracts includes a certain percentage of the shared public area within the building, and also a smaller percentage of the outdoor area shared by the entire neighborhood. Many property owners are unhappy after they found the area of their own apartment is more than 30% smaller than the area stated in their contract of purchase, and passed their mood down to the property management agencies. It is difficult to communicate to the residents as property managing workers in some neighborhoods, and it creates limitation to the services residents receive.

**Insight 3: Green Spaces**: The best way to enjoy the Eco-City is to work and live locally. When its not in the winter, I always see green vegetaions when I go around the city. My commute to work, supermarkets, and pick up my kids from school are all very pleasant experiences, being surrounded by nature allow me to be more relaxed. The natural landscape is preserved well here, I like to go to the central wetland park after dinner for a jog, where I can see some water birds from time to time.


## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. --->

**Financing Scheme**: As introduced above, the Eco-City is a joint venture between China and Singapore, including government agencies, public sector, and private sectors from both China and Singapore. Strictly 50% of the initial investment was from Chinese government owned sources, represented by Tianjin Infrastructure Investment Group. The other 50% of the initial investment was from Keppels Group, Singapore, which represents the combined support from Singaporean government and Singaporean private sectors. The Eco-City development also receives high-priority attention and continuous funding from the Chinese central government directly, as it lies on the new pan-Beijing economic belt in the economic planning visions.


## Outcomes
<!-- Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. About 50 words per is minimum, but these can be as long as you want/need. -->

**Highly aggressive sustainable implementation**:  The Eco-City was awarded the first place among cities globally in using a sustainable model of development for urban space, by [Construction 21 International](https://www.construction21.org/en/index.html). The Eco-City has accomplished its Sustainability KPIS, which regulated that the city needs to build dependency on sustainable resources. The completion encourages the city to take itself to the next level. The Eco-City is currently working to achieve its Sustainability 36 KPIs 2.0, which includes increasing the dependence on sustainable energy sources to more than 32%, and dependence on non-traditional sources of tap water to more than 60% by 2035. 

![Alt Text / logo](./susgoal.jpg "logo(Unsplash)")

**Gaining 140000 new residents as of 2023**:  Although the real-estate market is currently very low in China, it did not change the fact that the Eco-City is a very popular destination for people to move to. As of 2023, the population of permanent residents reached 140000, compared to 120000 in 2022. The Eco-City is also on-track in building a population foundation for future expansion. There are 34 schools and kindergardens in the city, serving 23400 students, which made close to 20% of the total population. These are indicators that the Eco-City has plenty of potential to continue developing in future.

**The nature is truly a good feature for residents**:  Using [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/), a platform similar to Reddit and Quora for the Chinese language internet, I viewed the posts by residents of the Eco-City related to how they live their life in the Eco-City. Although there are aspects in living there that troubles the residents, most of they found high coverage of vegetation and natural landscape extremely valuable. The post below is from a young lady who moved to the Eco-City two years ago, she has already bought a house and is actively getting ready to move in. She senses an oceanside vacation town vibe in the Eco-City, which gives her great comfort in everyday living. 

**Anticipate move in of technology firms**: For 2024, it is anticipated that more than 150 innovative technology firms would move into the Eco-City. This will bring more than three times open tech positions available compared to the Eco-City today. This will encourage more residents to move to the Eco-City. 
## Open Questions
<!-- Identify 1-3 open question(s). What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? These can be 50 words or less. -->

**Attracting corperate move-in**:  In terms of a location to establish a headquarter, the Eco-City is located at a awkward location, given its proximity to Beijing and Tianjin. Corperates can be attracted by high bonuses provided by the government, but this is a unsustainable strategy. What would be a strategy to bring more work opportunities to the Eco-City? 

**Dependence on cars**:  Although the Eco-City was built to be used comfortably without using private cars. However, the car ownership rate at the Eco-City is at a level close to American suburban areas. Residents are also used to travelling by their own car whenever it is possible, since the well-designed urban landscape allows easy travel by car. What does this tell us about the car-free motivation of smart cities, and the way residents interact with it?
