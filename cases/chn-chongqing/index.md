## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->
Chongqing, one of China's four municipalities with a population of over 30 million, is undergoing a transition from a traditional industrial hub to an innovative, smart, and digital metropolis. Known as "The Mountain City," the core of Chongqing's digital masterplan is the Chongqing Data Governance "14th Five-Year Plan" (2021-2025), which is also the theme of this case study. This comprehensive plan utilizes cutting-edge digital technologies to transform the city, with the goal of creating a smarter and more intelligent living environment for its residents and organizations. Overall, this case study provides insight into Chongqing's smart city plan, current progress, and citizen engagement by extensively researching, translating, and interpreting important policies and recent reports related to the plan. A complete list of information sources can be found at the end of the webpage.

## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Development:** The data governance plan of Chongqing clearly specifies the development of regulatory frameworks for the data factor market, the establishment of a data sharing and integration platform, and the upgrading of the data management and security system as the ultimate goals and key objectives for the city. This development strategy aligns with the development stage of the digital masterplanning process, which focuses on creating the necessary infrastructure for further digitization.

**Engagement:** As clarified in the stakeholder section, the key stakeholders of the data governance plan include multi-level governments, city big data application development departments, City Construction Investment Group Co., Ltd., and multiple technology companies. These stakeholders, along with the wider public and citizens, are actively involved in the execution process of the plan and have the opportunity to contribute to the city's transformation. The availability of beneficial one-stop services for citizens of all ages serves as strong evidence of citizen engagement.

**Implementation:** While the implementation of the digital masterplanning process is the stage where the plan realizes and executes the ideas, the three examples of technology interventions ("Elderly Care + Disability Assistance" service model, "Data Shield Evaluation Service - Western Data Transaction Center", "One-stop Service for Newborns") and the three high-level outcomes serve as valid indications of the current implementation progress in the city. Milestones in the development of essential infrastructure for data governance are consistently being reached effectively.

One of the key tasks mentioned in the interview is to speed up the construction of the Construction Information Model (CIM) platform in the housing and urban-rural development field, such as the Chongqing Railway East Station, for future data sharing between regional and city-level CIM platforms.

## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. -->
**Special Funds**. Multi-level departments of the city are advised to establish special funds to support and promote the digital technology innovation, data governance, and related work of the big data developement. One example of the special funds is named the "2023 Chongqing City Digital Economy Industry Development Special Fund Project", involving any sectors of software developement, information services, artificial intelligence, advanced computing, blockchain, and data governance. The applicant are required to be a company registered in Chongqing.

**Collaboration with Financial Institutions**. Financial institutions are encouraged to expand and innovate their services and financial products for entities in the data factor market. Government of Yuzhong District plans to expand the financing channels for digital economy. Banks are guided to accelerate the establshment of the "Yu Zhong Rong" platform and acheive intelligent matching between the financing needs of digital economy enterprises and financial institutions's derivative products.

**Special Financial Policy**
Meanwhile, government of Liangjiang District announced a policy in 2023, "The Chongqing Liangjiang District Special Policy to Promote the High-Quality Development of Software and Information Services Industry" to provide special financial assistances for targeted entities. One point is that it will offer a maximum of 3 million RMB financial support to encourage large and medium-sized enterprises to accommodate innovations in software and information-related businesses". Another point is that companies selected into the list of "nationally key software companies" will receive a reward of 2 million RMB. There are also special policies focusing on absorbing more talent to promote the city data plan.

## Outcomes
<!-- Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. About 50 words per is minimum, but these can be as long as you want/need. -->

**Integrated Urban Big Data Resource Center Project**. This project consists of three essential components: the City Big Data Resource Center, City Information Model, and the "Mountain City Chain" Construction Program. The center will upgrade the government data sharing and exchange system and the public data sharing system, refining easy search, statistical analysis, application display, and other useful functions for the citizens. The CIM, which centers around the three-dimensional spatial data of the city, will integrate infrastructure data, such as buildings and railways, with relevant construction and resource databases to form an open and collaborative data resource system. Moreover, the program will build a modular and multi-layered blockchain public service platform that merges with the smart city's intelligent hub and provides blockchain development framework and resources to governments and enterprises via cloud services.

**Data Fusion Application Project.** This project aims to enable "One Network Management, Service, Dispatch, and Governance" for citizens. Specifically, this project will build a comprehensive urban management database for real-time decision-making and operational guidance and upgrade the "Chongqing Fast Service" government platform for more convenient public services. Together they will improve the risk monitoring and disaster prevention ability of the government. Besides, "Smart supervision, traffic, medical, and agriculture" are other important aspects of this project, covering multiple facets of citizens' daily life, such as traceable market regulatory processes, a public traffic management system, digitalization of personal healthcare data and services, and agricultural analysis for farmers.

**Data Circulation Expansion Project.** "National Data Cyber Range" and "National Transaction Services Center" will be two major results of the project. The data cyber range refers to constructing a vast library of general-purpose big data algorithms and component libraries, involving functionalities such as natural language processing, image analysis, and data mining. To better prepare for emergent events, such as public health crises and natural disasters, regular exercises utilizing those data libraries will be conducted. Another center points to the "Western Data Transaction Center," a platform providing a comprehensive set of services about data transactions among governments, enterprises, and social entities. It targets standardizing and encouraging transactions in the data factor market.

## Open Questions
<!-- Identify 1-3 open question(s). What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? These can be 50 words or less. -->

**Public Communication**. Based on the current case study, Chongqing seems to lack a unified online official platform that can display the current progress and present real-time news. This would help citizens and interested entities to have a more accurate understanding of Chongqing's smart city construction progress.

**District-level Collaboration**. How do different districts collaborate on this data governance plan? Many of their regional plans are overlapping, and there exist many collaborations among entities in various districts.

**University Role**. What role does Chongqing University play during this construction process? Since Chongqing University is the best university in the city and is renowned for its urban planning and architecture discipline, I expect it to have more involvement in the data governance plan and the overall smart city project.
