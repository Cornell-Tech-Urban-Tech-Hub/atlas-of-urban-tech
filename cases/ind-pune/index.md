## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Smart Cities Mission of India was a key offering of the Indian government. Launched by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in 2015, it has been instrumental in facilitating communication and resource sharing between different parts of the Indian government to achieve better living standards for Indians in 100 cities across the country. Pune is the second largest city in the State of Maharashtra. As a major urban center, it is faced by challenges with inadequate infrastructure and environmental concerns due to its rapid urbanization. Under the Smart Cities Mission, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) implemented various initiatives to address these issues. Through the use of technology, IoT and Data Analytics, the city has improved its transport, waste management, healthcare offerings, and digital governance.

## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Infrastructure**.  The Smart City mission in Pune has focused on upgrading and modernizing its infrastructure. The city has made investments into improving roads, transportation systems and utilities. An example of this is the development of the Between the Road Transport System (BRTS) for public bus transportation. Other initiatives include the integration of IoT based systems for intelligent traffic management, waste management, and optimizing resource utilization.

**Digital Connectivity**.  The city is a major center of IT in the State. It thus recognizes the importance of digital connectivity to enable smart-solutions. In order to provide widespread access to high-speed internet, the city has established Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas to create a digital infrastructure that supports the implementation of smart technologies. This has empowered the citizens to make use of the applications that the city runs, such as e-governance platforms. The initiative works in close tandem with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

**Citizen Engagement and Participation**.  Pune places a significant emphasis on its citizen engagement and participation. The city has implemented various channels to empower citizens to make their voice heard. Through mobile apps (Pune Connect), social media channels and community outreach programs, citizens can provide inputs to decision making, report issues and actively participate in the development of their neighborhood.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- Summarize the most important goals of the project. Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. The text should be around 50 words. -->

The mission includes implementing smart solutions for e-governance, traffic management, delivering services, and citizen engagement. It aims to create a digitally powered city that utilizes technology for citizen-centric services.

## Technology Interventions
<!--  Identify 3-5 specific technology-enabled interventions the project employs or proposes. The text should be around 75-125 words. Separate into more than 1 paragraph as needed. This is a good place to insert additional images, be sure to include captions identifying the source and make sure to not use copyrighted images. -->

**Smart Grid System**. The smart grid system in Pune enables intelligent energy management, with real-time monitoring, analysis, and control of electricity distribution. The goal is to optimize energy consumption, reduce waste, and improve reliability. By integrating renewable energy sources and employing sophisticated metering infrastructure, the smart grid promotes sustainable practices and provides information to make informed decisions regarding energy usage.

**Smart Transportation System**.  The city employs technology to integrate various systems to allow for intelligent traffic management, real-time vehicle tracking, and smart parking solutions. Using data analytics and a network of sensors, it allows the city to efficiently manage the flow of traffic, minimizing congestion and travel time. Even with transport infrastructure, technology is being closely knit into these projects.

**E-governance Framework**.  Pune emphasizes the successful implementation of a robust e-governance framework. This intervention aims to digitize government services and processes and facilitate easy and transparent delivery of public services. By using technology, citizens can access various government services online, including payment of taxes, obtaining licenses, and accessing information. It streamlines the administrative procedure, reduces bureaucracy, and promotes citizen participation.

**Local Talent**. The Smart Cities Mission of India pulls from its local talent pool of students to create modern and relevant digital solutions. It empowers students to use their talent and skills to create solutions for the smart cities mission.

**Government Siloes**. A key hurdle that fellows faced during their implementation phase was the interfacing between different government departments. The difference in jurisdiction and authority made acquiring the necessary resources and information difficult in some cases.

**Private Sector Collaboration**. The fellowship creates solutions that are actionable and impactful. In cases where their scale and mandate is larger than what can be achieved by fellows, private sector partners are brought in to take the project to its completion.
