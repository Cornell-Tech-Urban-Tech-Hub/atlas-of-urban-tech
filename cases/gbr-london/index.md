## Overview

The Smarter London Together Plan is an ambitious roadmap developed by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and the Mayor of London (Sadiq Khan) to make the city a global leader in smart city technology. The plan focuses on improving digital leadership, fostering citywide collaboration, enhancing digital services, empowering Londoners with digital skills, and advancing data infrastructure. This strategy aims to harness technology and data to improve London's economy, environment, and quality of life. The roadmap builds on the last Smart London Plan in 2013 (updated in 2016), and it is a new approach based on the city’s collaborative missions (with the 33 local boroughs).

## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Development:** The plan was developed by the Mayor’s Chief Digital Officer and the Smart London Board. The plan was initiated by a Listening Tour that gathered views from various stakeholders, such as the tech sector, universities, councils, civil society and citizens. The plan also builds on the previous [Smart London Plan from 2013](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/smart_london_plan.pdf) and aligns with the seven statutory Mayoral strategies.

**Engagement:** The plan aims to engage citizens and communities better through initiatives such as [Talk London](https://www.london.gov.uk/talk-london/), a 42,000-strong online community where Londoners can share their opinions on various issues; [Crowdfund London](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/shaping-local-places/funding-opportunities/make-london/impact-community-crowdfunding), a digital platform for citizens to propose and fund ideas for their neighbourhoods; and [Civic Innovation Challenge](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/arts-and-culture/mayor-londons-civic-innovation-challenge), a programme that matches tech startups with public bodies and companies to solve urban challenges.

**Implementation:** The plan sets out five missions with specific actions and initiatives to achieve the vision of making London the smartest city in the world. The plan also proposes new structures and partnerships to support collaboration and innovation across public services, such as the London Office for Data Analytics (LODA) ([superseded by the City Data Analytics Programme](https://data.london.gov.uk/loda/#:~:text=The%20London%20Office%20of%20Data,link%20to%20find%20out%20more.)), the [London Office of Technology & Innovation (LOTI)](https://loti.london/), and the [Connected London programme](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/connected-london). The plan also includes report cards to track progress and impact.

**Public support and resources**.
A key insight for cities looking to develop their own smart city initiatives is the importance of leveraging procurement, persuasion, and fundraising to create programs that garner support and resources. By strategically utilizing these tools, cities can attract partnerships from the private sector, academic institutions, and other stakeholders, fostering a collaborative environment for innovation and progress. An example from the Smarter London Together plan was the Listening Tour, which involved engaging with citizens and collecting their input, this in turn helped London gain the trust of the public and ensure that their concerns were addressed. This approach not only amplifies the impact of smart city projects, but also encourages knowledge-sharing and accelerates the pace of urban transformation, ultimately benefiting the communities they serve. By actively involving residents in the decision-making process, cities can create smart city solutions that are not only technologically advanced, but also truly responsive to the needs and desires of the people they are designed to serve.

**Shift from private sector to public sector investments**.
One key insight from this conversation is the shifting focus of smart city initiatives in London. In the 2013 plan, there was more emphasis on engaging the private sector, particularly SMEs (Small Medium Sized Enterprises) and startups, to develop and deliver innovative technologies and services. However, the 2018 plan shifted the focus to public sector investments to improve the city for its residents. One notable difference between the two plans is the attention given to infrastructure and broadband connectivity. The 2018 plan recognized the importance of connectivity as a crucial part of the smart city concept, whereas the 2013 plan did not view it as a smart city issue. This change reflects the evolving priorities and understanding of what constitutes a smart city and the role that infrastructure and connectivity play in creating a more inclusive and sustainable urban environment.

**Smart city master plan governance**.
In the future of digital master planning, the leadership structure for smart city development may shift towards a more versatile and adaptable approach. Cities may need to assign the responsibility of leading a smart city master plan to a specific department, such as analytics, climate, housing, or others, depending on the primary focus and objectives of the project. This would ensure that the team with the most relevant expertise takes charge, fostering a more targeted and efficient development process. However, cross-departmental collaboration would remain essential in order to create well-rounded, inclusive, and sustainable smart cities.

## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. -->

**Financing Scheme**.

A shift occurred from seeking private sector fundraising to relying on public sector financing for the plan. This change was partly due to the political party transition in 2016, and led to the introduction of new initiatives that focused more on addressing public needs rather than catering to private interests.

**Some examples of financing:**

[The Sharing Cities programme](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/smart-london/sharing-cities), which pilots smart technologies to support the green transition in Greenwich and other European cities, is funded by a [€25 million](https://cities-today.com/european-smart-cities-programme-hits-e250-million-investment-milestone/) grant from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme.

[The Civic Innovation Challenge](https://www.technologyrecord.com/article/mayor-of-london-and-microsoft-launch-civic-innovation-challenge), which matches tech startups with public bodies and companies to solve urban challenges, is funded by the Mayor of London and partners such as Microsoft, Social Tech Trust and the TfL.

## Outcomes
<!-- Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. About 50 words per is minimum, but these can be as long as you want/need. -->

**Improved public engagement and participation:** The plan has enabled more Londoners to have a voice and a stake in the city’s policies and projects through online platforms such as [Talk London](https://www.london.gov.uk/talk-london/), [Make London](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/shaping-local-spaces/regeneration-funding-opportunities/make-london) and [Pay-it-Forward](https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/over-15m-raised-through-pay-it-forward-london). These platforms have facilitated citizen feedback, crowdfunding, co-design and co-delivery of digital services and solutions that meet user needs and preferences.

**Enhanced data sharing and innovation:** This initiative has laid the groundwork for integrating data across London’s public services, thus assisting decision-making, service delivery, and recovery. The plan has also created new data services and platforms such as the [Planning Datahub](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/planning/digital-planning/planning-london-datahub) (live feed of all planning applications in city), the [High Streets Data Service](https://data.london.gov.uk/high-street-data-service/) (detailed local economic data using spend and footfall from private sources) and the [Cultural Infrastructure Map](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/arts-and-culture/cultural-infrastructure-toolbox/cultural-infrastructure-map) (open data on cultural assets) that provide valuable insights and information for various stakeholders and sectors. The plan has also developed a new city data platform and governance model that will enable legal, ethical and secure data sharing across the city by the end of 2022.

**Increased digital connectivity and infrastructure:** The plan has improved digital access and inclusion for all Londoners by mobilising public assets to expand gigabit-capable internet speeds, supporting smart infrastructure projects and promoting common standards for fibre and mobile connectivity. The plan has also prepared London for the roll out of 5G and emerging technologies that can enable new applications and opportunities. The plan has also adopted the most comprehensive planning policies in the UK on digital connectivity and smart infrastructure in future developments through the new London Plan.

**Strengthened digital skills and leadership:** Smarter London Together has developed the talent needed for the future by providing basic and advanced digital skills training for young Londoners, upskilling teachers and public sector workers, supporting diversity and inclusion in the tech sector and fostering digital and data leadership across the city. The plan has also supported cultural institutions to adapt to the digital age. The plan has also introduced a new statutory skills entitlement for Londoners with no or low digital skills to access fully funded entry and Level 1 digital skills courses.

**Scaled-up green tech and mobility:** This initiative has championed the city’s green transition by scaling up smart technologies that can help reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality, promote active travel and enhance energy efficiency. It has also supported innovation in mobility services such as e-scooters, demand-responsive buses, smart parking and autonomous vehicles. The plan has also collaborated with other European cities on green tech initiatives such as [Sharing Cities](https://sharingcities.eu/). The plan has also published a [series of playbooks](https://sharingcities.eu/smart-booklets/) on the scaling of smart cities infrastructure to support the Green New Deal.

**Increased collaboration and innovation:** The plan has created new institutions that enable collaboration at scale across London’s public services, such as the London Office of Technology and Innovation (LOTI) and TfL’s Innovation team. It has also developed expertise in open call approaches that foster valuable innovation and partnerships with scale-ups and the tech sector. A [joint initiative](https://oecd-opsi.org/innovations/global-innovation-collaborative/) with Berlin, New York and Paris has been launched to accelerate the revival of central London and bolster the resilience of businesses impacted by COVID.
