## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Smart Cities team at the Office of Innovation was launched in 2017 to advance San Antonio’s use of innovation, data, and technology to improve quality of life. The City Council designated three Innovation Zones (Downtown, Brooks and the Medical Center). In 2018 the SmartSA Partnership was established and a survey of residents who live, work, and play in the Innovation Zones was conducted. Leveraging the SmartSA Partnership and Innovation Zones, the Smart Cities team executed more than 30 pilots and projects in response to resident challenges since 2018, earning national recognition. This roadmap represents a bold and innovative approach for building an accessible, connected, and efficient city that keeps residents informed and safe. It uses a “people-centered” model for smart city development, where residents drive guiding-principles for how city government should use technology, data, and innovation to solve problems and increase quality of life.

## Goals and Aspirations

For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities in digital master plans (development, engagement, implementation). For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of innovation hubs?
-->

**People centered**. San Antonio’s smart city approach puts emphasis on community engagement. They focused on defining problems with stakeholders and then identified the best way to solve those challenges, rather than leading with a new technology and retroactively trying to find ways to force that technology to address a need. They value buy-in from their community, partners, and city staff, and put effort in including them in the process of setting expectations and values for the role that technology plays in the community.

**Commitment to open data principles and transparent data governance policies**.  San Antonio was one of the first cities to create an Interlocal Data Sharing Agreement amongst public agencies. The IDSA provides a transfer and security protocol for data sharing across nine public agencies that are signatories to the agreement including: CPS-Energy, VIA Metropolitan Transit, San Antonio Water System, UTSA, Opportunity Home, San Antonio River Authority, Bexar County Appraisal District, Edwards Aquifer Authority and the City of San Antonio. The SmartSA partnership meets monthly to identify opportunities for collaboration and projects that can be powered by the data sharing agreement. For example, the SmartSA Smart Streetlight Pilot Program used the agreement to share sensor data from smart streetlights between CPS-Energy and the City of San Antonio to provide on its open data platform, data.sanantonio.gov.

**Smart city as a service**.  San Antonio’s smart cities team put their focus on leveraging innovation, data and technology to improve public services. The roadmap is backed by a governance process they built in collaboration with their IT and procurement departments, which quickens how smart city solutions can be prototyped within the City. The Team carved out this process with IT and it brings forward all required inputs/approvals from relevant City stakeholders to ensure that if a prototype is successful, that the City department sponsoring it can fund/scale it thereafter. This allows them to institutionalize smart cities as a process within government, and deliver their model that aims to leverage their expertise in emerging technologies and innovation as a service providing to residents and city departments.
