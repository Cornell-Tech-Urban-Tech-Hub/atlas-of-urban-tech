## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

What makes a good innovation ecosystem? According to research on the topic, many studies point to a few key things: networks, talent, and innovators. These things might be described with different terms, however, overall their impact remains the same, according to the following functions they perform: research & development within academia and industry, research institutions to support these functions, and enough jobs to support a collaborative environment. Montreal seems to have check all the boxes of a great innovation ecosystem. So what does that mean for the city itself? 

## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?

****.  Montreals Smart and Digital City Action Plan focuses on improving Quality of Life and improving economic development. What are the specifics? 

**City as a Lab**.  Montreal's innovation community experiments with concrete solutions to problems of mobility, food, and municipal regulations. This program makes it possible to quickly implement concreate solutions imagined by the community to test them with citizens. 

**Bottom-Up Approach to Governance**.  Whether it's the 10-year masterplan, or current projects, Montreal is focused on consulting with citizens to develop solutions from the ground up. Over the next 10 years, the goal is to speek up the ecological transition, strengthen solidarity, equality, and inclusion, promote democracy and participation, and stimulate innovation and creativity. Have smart city initiatives helped with this?

## Stakeholders
<!--  Identify 3-5 key stakeholder organizations or groups. The text should be around 50 words, and include a link to the organization.-->

**Industry**.  Industry stakeholders are companies and businesses directly involved in or affected by the implementation of the smart city plan. This group includes tech companies who design and produce smart technologies (IoT devices, sensors, AI software, data analytics tools, etc.), construction and infrastructure firms who are responsible for integrating these technologies into the city's physical infrastructure, telecommunication companies, energy providers, and transport organizations. They stand to gain from new business opportunities that arise as a result of the city's transformation. Their innovations, expertise, and resources are critical to driving the smart city initiative forward. For instance, with its AI-focused research lab, Microsoft Research Montreal, the tech giant is a key stakeholder in the city's AI initiatives. And, in 2019, DeepMind announced the opening of a new research lab in Montreal, further solidifying the city's status as a global AI hub. [Google Deepmind](https://www.deepmind.com/)

**Government**.  Government stakeholders include local city administrators, provincial and national officials, and regulators. The Montreal City Government, as the entity initiating the smart city plan, plays a pivotal role in the overall decision-making, funding, regulation, and coordination of the initiative. They are responsible for ensuring that the plan aligns with the city's broader strategic goals, serves public interests, and complies with laws and regulations. They also have to maintain transparency and engage the public in the decision-making process. Other government bodies, like provincial and national governments, might be involved in providing support, setting policy, and regulation.

**Academia**. Universities, research institutions, and other academic bodies are crucial for the research and development aspect of the smart city initiative. They can help design, test, and improve smart technologies, and study the impact of these technologies on various aspects of city life. They can also provide education and training to prepare the workforce for a tech-centric urban environment. Their research can inform policy-making and contribute to making the initiative more effective and sustainable. In Montreal, universities such as McGill University and Université de Montréal may have significant involvement in this aspect. [Organization Name](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
