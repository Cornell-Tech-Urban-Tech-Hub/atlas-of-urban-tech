## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP) is located on the east of Suzhou city, in the Jiangsu Province of China, which is about 43.8 miles west of Shanghai. It is a joint venture between Singapore and China as a way to promote economic cooperation between the two countries. It occupies a 71,175-acre (288 square kilometer) zone including various industrial and residential areas.

SIP was first established in 1994 and has been undergoing continuous development ever since. In 2022, the new SIP Digital Master Plan (2022-2025) was announced to further enhance SIPâ€™s competitiveness and attractiveness.

Over the past three decades, SIP has made significant efforts in smart city initiatives which include but are not limited to areas of environment, government, transportation, education, healthcare, and living. SIP aims to become a world-class hub for innovation, enhance the quality of life for residents, promote sustainable development, and drive economic growth.
