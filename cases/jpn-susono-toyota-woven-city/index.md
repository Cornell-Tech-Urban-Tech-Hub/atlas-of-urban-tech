**Autonomous Mobility Solutions**  
The primary street network features autonomous vehicles optimized for shared transportation, delivery services, and mobile retail. Toyota's e-Palette vehicles will play a significant role in shared mobility and logistics, offering flexible, on-demand services. Recreational promenades and pathways allow residents to navigate safely using personal mobility devices like bicycles, scooters, and Toyota's i-Walk. Additionally, an underground logistics network handles goods delivery, ensuring efficient city operations. This multi-modal mobility network, supported by Toyota's Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), will contribute to reduced congestion and improved connectivity within Woven City.

**Hydrogen Energy Infrastructure**  
Woven City will use hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity for the entire city, supported by solar and geothermal energy sources. Hydrogen-powered infrastructure ensures a carbon-neutral, sustainable ecosystem, providing clean energy for transportation, homes, and businesses. This infrastructure will deliver power not only for daily living but also for transportation needs, contributing to a resilient power grid. By combining hydrogen fuel cells with other renewable energy sources, Woven City aims to establish a model for sustainable, carbon-neutral urban living.
