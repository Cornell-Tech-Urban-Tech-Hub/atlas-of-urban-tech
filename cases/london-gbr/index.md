## Overview

The Smarter London Together Plan is an ambitious roadmap developed by the Greater London Authority (GLA) and the Mayor of London (Sadiq Khan) to make London a global leader in smart city technology. The plan focuses on improving digital leadership, fostering citywide collaboration, enhancing digital services, empowering Londoners with digital skills, and advancing data infrastructure. This strategy aims to harness the potential of technology and data to improve London's economy, environment, and quality of life for its residents. The roadmap builds on the last Smart London Plan in 2013 (updated in 2016) and is a new approach based on collaborative missions (with the 33 local boroughs).


## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Development:** The plan was developed by the Mayor’s Chief Digital Officer and the Smart London Board, initated by a Listening Tour that gathered views from various stakeholders, such as the tech sector, universities, councils, civil society and citizens. The plan also builds on the previous [Smart London Plan from 2013](https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/smart_london_plan.pdf) and aligns with the seven statutory Mayoral strategies.

**Engagement:** The plan aims to engage citizens and communities better through initiatives such as [Talk London](https://www.london.gov.uk/talk-london/), a 42,000-strong online community where Londoners can share their opinions on various issues; [Crowdfund London](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/shaping-local-places/funding-opportunities/make-london/impact-community-crowdfunding), a digital platform for citizens to propose and fund ideas for their neighbourhoods; and [Civic Innovation Challenge](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/arts-and-culture/mayor-londons-civic-innovation-challenge), a programme that matches tech startups with public bodies and companies to solve urban challenges.

**Implementation:** The plan sets out five missions with specific actions and initiatives to achieve the vision of making London the smartest city in the world. The plan also proposes new structures and partnerships to support collaboration and innovation across public services, such as the London Office for Data Analytics (LODA) ([superseded by the City Data Analytics Programme](https://data.london.gov.uk/loda/#:~:text=The%20London%20Office%20of%20Data,link%20to%20find%20out%20more.)), the [London Office of Technology & Innovation (LOTI)](https://loti.london/), and the [Connected London programme](https://www.london.gov.uk/programmes-strategies/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/connected-london). The plan also includes report cards to track progress and impact.

**Insight 1**.
A key insight for cities looking to develop their own smart city initiatives is the importance of leveraging procurement, persuasion, and fundraising to create programs that garner support and resources. By strategically utilizing these tools, cities can attract partnerships from the private sector, academic institutions, and other stakeholders, fostering a collaborative environment for innovation and progress. An example for the Smarter London Together the plan was the Listening Tour, which involved engaging with citizens and collecting their input, this in turn help London gain the trust of the public and ensure that their concerns were addressed. This approach not only amplifies the impact of smart city projects, but also encourages knowledge-sharing and accelerates the pace of urban transformation, ultimately benefiting the communities they serve. By actively involving residents in the decision-making process, cities can create smart city solutions that are not only technologically advanced, but also truly responsive to the needs and desires of the people they are designed to serve.


**Insight 2**.
One key insight from this conversation is the shifting focus of smart city initiatives in London. In the 2013 plan, there was more emphasis on engaging the private sector, particularly SMEs and startups, to develop and deliver innovative technologies and services. However, the 2018 plan, shifted the focus to public sector investments to improve the city for its residents. One notable difference between the two plans is the attention given to infrastructure and broadband connectivity. The 2018 plan recognized the importance of connectivity as a crucial part of the smart city concept, whereas the 2013 plan did not view it as a smart city issue. This change reflects the evolving priorities and understanding of what constitutes a smart city and the role that infrastructure and connectivity play in creating a more inclusive and sustainable urban environment.

**Insight 3**.
In the future of digital master planning, the leadership structure for smart city development may shift towards a more versatile and adaptable approach. Decisions may be made to assign the responsibility of leading a smart city master plan to a specific department, such as analytics, climate, housing, or others, depending on the primary focus and objectives of the project. This would ensure that the team with the most relevant expertise takes charge, fostering a more targeted and efficient development process. However, cross-departmental collaboration would remain essential in order to create well-rounded, inclusive, and sustainable smart cities. 

## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. -->

**Financing Scheme**.

A shift occurred from seeking private sector fundraising to relying on public sector financing for the plan. This change was partly due to the political party transition in 2016, and led to the introduction of new initiatives that focused more on addressing public needs rather than catering to private interests.


**Some examples of financing:**

[The Sharing Cities programme](https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/business-and-economy/supporting-londons-sectors/smart-london/sharing-cities), which pilots smart technologies to support the green transition in Greenwich and other European cities, is funded by a [€25 million](https://cities-today.com/european-smart-cities-programme-hits-e250-million-investment-milestone/) grant from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 programme.

The Civic Innovation Challenge, which matches tech startups with public bodies and companies to solve urban challenges, is funded by the Mayor of London and partners such as Microsoft, Social Tech Trust and the TfL.
