## Overview

The Energizing Kowloon East Initiative, announced in the 2011-12 Policy Address, is a strategic plan to transform Kowloon East into an attractive alternative Central Business District (CBD2) to support Hong Kong's long-term economic development. The initiative covers the areas of Kai Tak, Kwun Tong, and Kowloon Bay, with an extension to San Po Kong in 2017.
