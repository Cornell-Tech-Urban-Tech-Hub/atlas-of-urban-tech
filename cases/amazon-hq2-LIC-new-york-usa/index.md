## Overview
Amazon wanted to build a brand new headquarters on the east coast of North America. Cities bid on the opportunity to host the new headquarters. Eventually Long Island City and Crystal City were selected as finalist. The new headquarters were expected to have a massive impact on the city's economy and in exchange Amazon would get major tax breaks.
