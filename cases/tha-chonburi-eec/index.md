## Financing
<!--  How are the technology interventions identified to be financed? How does this fit into financing of the larger project? Identify at least one financing mechanism that is being used. -->

**Financing Scheme**. The Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) smart city project relies heavily on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for funding and implementation. PPPs are collaborative arrangements between the government and private sector entities to finance and develop critical infrastructure projects within the EEC, such as high-speed rail lines, airports, ports, and smart city components. The Thai government partners with private companies, both domestic and international, to share the costs, risks, and responsibilities of these large-scale infrastructure projects, and the majority of the funding is from the private side. This funding scheme can be beneficial because private sector partners bring their expertise, technology, and resources to design, build, and operate the infrastructure assets, while the government provides land, regulatory support, and other incentives. Additionally, PPPs in the EEC project are typically long-term arrangements, spanning several decades. These long-term partnerships ensure the sustainability and continuity of the project, as private partners have a vested interest in the successful operation and maintenance of the infrastructure assets.

## Outcomes
<!-- What results has the project produced to date? What outcomes and impacts are anticipated? Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. -->

**Increased Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Growth**. To date, the EEC smart city project has attracted substantial foreign direct investment in targeted industries such as automotive, electronics, and digital technology. The advanced infrastructure, favorable business environment, and incentives (primarily tax) provided by the project have boosted investor confidence and positioned Thailand as a compelling investment destination. The influx of FDI is expected to drive economic growth, create new jobs, and contribute to the overall development of the EEC region and Thailand as a whole. As a result, foreign direct investments have also strengthened foreign affairs & diplomatic ties with various countries.

**Belts & Roads Initiative**. The Eastern Economic Corridor plays a significant role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The region is strategically located along the maritime Silk Road, the proximity to the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea makes it an important gateway for trade and connectivity between China and Southeast Asian countries, and the infrastructure development, with its deep-sea ports, airports, and high-speed rail connections, enhances the logistics and transportation capabilities along the maritime Silk Road.

**Behavioral Change and Public Awareness**.  The EEC smart city project includes initiatives to raise public awareness about the benefits of high-speed rail and encourage a shift in transportation habits. The project aims to foster a culture of public transportation usage, highlighting the convenience, reliability, and environmental advantages of high-speed rail compared to car travel. By influencing public perception and behavior, the project seeks to accelerate the transition from a car-dependent society to one that embraces high-speed rail and sustainable mobility solutions. This anticipated outcome can greatly transform Thailand in positive ways as the current car-reliant infrastructure causes many issues such as traffic, pollution, and climate change.

## Open Questions
<!-- What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? Identify 1-3 open question(s). -->

**Environmental Sustainability and Resilience**. While the EEC smart city project emphasizes sustainable development, there are questions about the long-term environmental impact of the project. How will the project ensure that the rapid urbanization and industrialization in the EEC region do not lead to environmental degradation, pollution, or loss of biodiversity? What will be the measures to build resilience against climate change risks, such as rising sea levels, flooding, or extreme weather events, which could impact the smart city infrastructure? The EEC region is by the coastline of Thailand, so its resiliency against climate change risks should be well studied.

**Social Inclusion and Equity**. How will the EEC smart city project ensure that the benefits of economic growth and technological advancements are distributed equitably among different segments of society? Will the project have adequate measures in place to prevent the widening of the digital divide and to promote inclusive access to smart city services and opportunities? How will the project address potential concerns around gentrification, displacement, and affordability for local communities? This issue is crucial given the massive wealth inequality in Thailand.

**Data Governance and Privacy**. With the extensive collection and use of data in the EEC smart city, there are questions about data governance, privacy, and security. How will the project ensure the responsible and ethical use of citizen data, preventing misuse, breaches, or unauthorized access? What will be the mechanisms for citizens to have control over their personal data and to seek redress in case of any violations? This is an issue that has not been discussed in depth & should be a major point of concern given the large amount of hacks & data leaks that have affected the Thai government.

**Policy Continuity and Consistency**. Thailand has experienced frequent changes in government and political leadership in recent years, raising concerns about the continuity and consistency of policies related to the EEC project. Will the vision, objectives, and implementation plans for the EEC smart city remain stable across different political administrations? How will potential shifts in political priorities or ideologies impact the long-term support and resources allocated to the project? The instability & corruption can affect investor confidence and perception of the EEC project, especially among foreign investors.
