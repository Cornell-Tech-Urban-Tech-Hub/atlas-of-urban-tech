## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Busan Eco Delta Smart City is an 2,773 square meter development project located in Gangseo-gu, Busan. Its development began in 2012 and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. The project's main objective is to provide a variety of services, including housing commerce, research and development, logistics, and more, to its target population of 76,000 people or 30,000 households. This project is being initiated jointly by Busan Metropolitan City, K-water, and Busan Metropolitan Corporation. The city was designed to be smart from the outset and was announced as a pilot project in 2018. With cutting-edge technology such as robots, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence, the community plans to provide residents with greater convenience. 


## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Smart Growth**. The Busan Eco Delta Smart City project focuses on spatial planning for smart growth, integrating work and home to provide citizens with more accessible and diverse activities 24/7. The city's 7 themed streets connect various functional areas for culture, leisure, and daily life to encourage community activities. The project also emphasizes sharing the environmental benefits of the city, designated as a heritage site, with everyone. The smart innovation center features a data-hub, showroom, brand exhibition, startup assist center, R&D plug-in support, creator space, and more. The project includes themed spaces for waterfront ecology experiences, leisure, and daily activities along the Macdo River, Pyeonggang Stream, and West Nakdong River. The city planning includes five innovation clusters to create decent jobs, such as healthcare and robot clusters, water-thermal energy clusters, and a new Korean Wave AR/VR cluster. The project includes assisted housing for the underprivileged, city informatization, mandatory BIM design for public structures, and application of private sector data in link with digital twin technology for city operations. Finally, the project explores potentials for implementation of integrated smart underground infrastructure with involved parties.

**Sustainable Urban Innovations**. The Busan Eco Delta Smart City project focuses on Sustainable Urban Innovations, including the Eco Delta Smart City Platform. The platform consists of a digital city platform, an augmented city platform, and a robot city platform, optimized for robotics development and applications. The project emphasizes shared infrastructure elements between services to reduce development costs and allow the entire city to be used as a testing lab, promoting bottom-up development. The aim is to implement a cutting-edge digital platform that covers the entire city, providing flexibility that other cities do not offer. The project also includes the implementation of an AR platform, meeting the trend of internet to mobile to augmented service to provide immersive experiences and improve the decision-making process. The project optimizes the city for bot applications to promote utilization and industrial growth, ensuring a sustainable urban environment for the future.

**Top-down and bottom-up approaches.**. The Busan Eco Delta Smart City project focuses on ten innovative ways to add value to urban living, using a people-led, bottom-up approach for field-specific innovations and a top-down approach for strategic objectives. The bottom-up approach includes challenges to find final solutions for selected issues through contests between businesses, living labs to develop innovation tasks, and testbeds to validate technologies and ideas with real-life settings and residents. The top-down approach includes special and common objectives, with areas of focus on life innovation with city-bots, LWP integration, intelligent administration and management, smart water, zero-energy city, smart education and living, post-industrial innovation community, smart healthcare, smart mobility, smart safety, and a sustainable city to last for generations, all designed to create an independent and creative smart citizen, proactive and intelligent public services, and a smart park.
