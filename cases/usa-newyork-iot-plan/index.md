## Stakeholders
<!--  Who initiated the project? Who is leading the project forward? Who else has a say in how it unfolds? Who is directly affected but marginalized? Identify 3-5 key stakeholder organizations or groups. Identify 3-5 key individuals. These are people who are associated with the project as leaders, supporters, critics, or regulators. They are likely to be members of the stakeholder groups identified above. These are people you should try to contact for one or more interviews.-->

**The Mayor's Office of the CTO**.  The Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer (NYC CTO) launched a set of efforts to organize the City’s approach to IoT. The City can help ensure potential partners in academia, industry, and the broader community have clear paths to engage with the City to demonstrate the efficacy of new technologies [NYC Office of Technology and Innovation](https://www.nyc.gov/content/oti/pages/)

**Residents**.  NYC residents play a critical role in the adoption of IoT strategies, and a large portion of the plan is dedicatied to the transparency and collaboration with redidents. Resident feedback is collected and used to shape the policies and pilot tests in for future IoT projects.

**Businesses and Community-Based Organizations**.  Private companies exert significant influence on New York City's IoT ecosystem through various means. They utilize IoT technologies for their own business operations, develop and market products and services used across different sectors, and employ local residents to carry out these activities. Similarly, community groups engage with IoT technologies, collaborate with the city on projects, and utilize public data to advance their initiatives. These community groups also play a role in promoting public engagement in IoT projects and educating the public about the broader implications and impacts of IoT across society.

## Technology Recommendations
<!--  What specific technology-enabled interventions does the project propose? Identify 3-5 technology interventions. Describe use cases, value proposition, solution architecture, data created or consumed, key platforms and standards, business models, regulatory issues, etc. Separate into more than 1 paragraph as needed. This is a good place to insert additional images, be sure to include captions identifying the source and make sure to not use copyrighted images. -->

**Recommendations in Government**. The government aims to strengthen its capacity in IoT by fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and resource utilization. This involves establishing a Smart City Collaborative to facilitate information exchange among city agencies and developing internal consultancy programs to support IoT projects. Additionally, the government plans to expand its "Rapid IoT" program for quick and cost-effective technology demonstrations.

In terms of innovation, the city intends to explore emerging technologies and test new sensing and power technologies through pilot programs. It plans to create a municipal testbed for experimentation and support the development of IoT wireless communication networks.

Furthermore, the government emphasizes the importance of partnerships by providing clear pathways for engagement with academia, industry, and community organizations. It aims to foster collaboration opportunities and establish continuous pilot programs within the testbed framework.

Data sharing is a priority, with efforts to maximize the use of government data and establish a real-time IoT data platform for agencies and the public.
