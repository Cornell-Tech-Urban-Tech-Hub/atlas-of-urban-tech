## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

The Yongsan International Business District (YIBD) is a large-scale urban development project in Seoul, South Korea, aiming to transform a 495,000 square meter area (half the size of Manhattan, 4.4 times the size of the Hudson Yard Development Project) into a global business hub. Launched in 2001, the project has undergone various challenges and revisions, with the current plan focusing on creating a smart city district that integrates innovative technologies and sustainable design principles [1]. The YIBD will feature eco-friendly high-rise buildings, smart infrastructure, and a vibrant urban environment, incorporating cutting-edge technologies in transportation, energy, city management, and disaster prevention systems [2]. The project is expected to be completed by 203N (exact timeline undetermined) and aims to serve as a model for future urban development projects in Korea.

## Goals and Aspirations

<!-- What is the project trying to achieve? Identify 3-5 high-level goals that define the entire project.Replace the placeholder title with a succinct name for the goal. -->

**Establish a Global Business Hub**. Historically, the Yongsan area served as the center of water transportation during the Joseon Dynasty and the Korean Empire, a Japanese military base during the Japanese colonial period, and a railway vehicle maintenance depot in the modern era [2].

Currently, under the 2040 Seoul City Basic Plan [3], Yongsan is designated as the central area of the three sub-centers, connecting the existing city center, Yeouido, and Gangnam. The area is undergoing significant changes, with the relocation of the current South Korean president's office to Yongsan, the railway underground project (Special Act on Underground Railways passed in the National Assembly on January 9, 2024), and a shift in the cultural hub of Seoul (due to Yongsan Gateway), transforming it into a new center of South Korea.

In this context, YIBD aims to transform Yongsan into a world-class international business district, capitalizing on its strategic location as the geographical center and transportation hub of Seoul. By benchmarking strategies of major cities worldwide (e.g., New York's Hudson Yards project, London's Canary Wharf project) that have sought to improve their competitiveness through the active development of declining urban spaces, the goal is to create a multi-functional smart urban space that enables diverse activities 24 hours a day.

![Alt Text / Street View of YIBD from Han River](./images/fig2_YIBDfromHanRiver.jpg "Seoul Metropolitan Government")

**Develop a Smart and Innovative City**. The city government is aiming for YIBD to be a testbed for smart city technologies and innovations, incorporating keywords of a future urban environment in response to global issues such as climate change, pandemics, high-tech mobility, digital transformation, and technological competition. The district will integrate various cutting-edge solutions, including Urban Air Mobility (UAM), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS), Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, Local Dynamic Maps (LDM), smart logistics, home healthcare systems, Online-to-Offline (O2O) services, digital twin-based disaster prevention systems, drone-based firefighting systems, energy self-sufficiency tech, smart eco-systems, resource circulation, and smart grids with energy storage systems (ESS). These technologies will optimize urban operations, enhance sustainability, and improve the quality of life for residents and workers, positioning the YIBD as a hub for innovation and collaboration.

**Establish a Comprehensive Three-Dimensional Transportation Network**. The YIBD will prioritize the development of a comprehensive and efficient transportation system, designed as a three-dimensional network integrating walkways and various modes of transport seamlessly. The main structure consists of pedestrian streets at ground level, autonomous shuttles and personal mobility devices on the first underground level, and a transportation network on the second and third underground levels connecting the district internally and externally. UAM services will provide aerial transportation options, connecting the YIBD to key locations. Advanced intelligent urban transportation systems like C-ITS and V2X communication will optimize traffic flow and enhance road safety.

![Alt Text / Transportation network diagram of YIBD](./images/fig4_Transportation_network_diagram.png "Seoul Metropolitan Government")

**Create a Green and Eco-Friendly Urban Environment**. The YIBD will also focus on creating a pleasant and eco-friendly living environment by incorporating an extensive network of green spaces, parks, and open areas, reaching approximately the same area as the project's footprint (around 500,000 square meters) by utilizing the entire space three-dimensionally from underground to ground level and up to the upper levels.

The plan is to secure 20% of the total YIBD area as parks and green spaces, utilize 30% as open green spaces using private public spaces, and secure the remaining 50% or so through green terraces, rooftop and facade greening. The green spaces will be connected to Yongsan Park and the Han River through pedestrian networks, transforming Yongsan into a city filled with green ecological spaces.

In South Korea, the Seoul Metropolitan Government's architectural review process for securing such green spaces is particularly strict, as the conditions for building height and building-to-land ratio are tied to the secured green area (in some cases, there may even be disadvantages to the development). Currently, it is estimated that plans for incentives related to green areas are being established by the Seoul Metropolitan Government and are expected to be finalized and delivered to each cooperation before the completion of base infrastructure construction in 2028.

It remains to be seen how the project stakeholders will navigate this challenge and ensure that the YIBD achieves its goal of becoming a showcase for smart city development while maintaining its financial feasibility.

**2. Long-term Adaptability and Resilience**: Another open question is the YIBD's ability to adapt and remain resilient in the face of rapidly evolving technologies and changing urban needs. As the project has a long development timeline, spanning from 2025 to 2039, it is crucial that the district's infrastructure and systems are designed with flexibility and future-proofing in mind. The success of the YIBD will depend on its capacity to accommodate new technologies, respond to shifting market demands, and maintain its relevance as a smart city hub over the long term.

**3. Connectivity between the Newly Developed YIBD Area and the Adjacent Urban Area**: A significant open question is about the integration and connectivity between the newly developed YIBD area and the existing urban districts. As the YIBD is being built within an established urban context, it is essential to ensure that the district seamlessly merges with its surroundings, both physically and socially. This involves creating efficient transportation links, pedestrian-friendly connections, and coherent urban design that respects the local character and heritage. Moreover, the project must foster synergies between the new development and the adjacent neighborhoods, encouraging social interaction, economic spillovers, and a sense of community cohesion. Achieving this harmonious integration will be a critical challenge for the YIBD project, as it seeks to create a vibrant and inclusive urban environment that enhances the overall quality of life in the area.
