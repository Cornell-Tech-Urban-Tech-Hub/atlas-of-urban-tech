description: Royal Stockholm Seaport has a lot of potential to look into, the plan has considered sustainability into many hard systems of the district such as its utility system and public infrastructure. Moreover, as the cruise ships (a harmful factor towards sustainability) stopping locally was historically important for the local economy, there might also be a conflict of interest.
