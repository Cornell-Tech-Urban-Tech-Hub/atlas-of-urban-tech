## Overview

<!-- About 100 to 150 word summary of the case study. -->

Zaragoza is a Spanish city located at the halfway point between Madrid and Barcelona. In 2005, Zaragoza Mayor Juan Alberto Belloch proposed the Digital Mile project, as he saw the development of the new high-speed railway system that was being built as an opportunity for urban redevelopment in the city. This was even moreso as the new railway system now placed Zaragoza within commuting distance of Spain's two largest cities. 
Not long after the project was set in motion, Zaragoza was appointed to be the location of the international exposition. As a result, plans for the Digital Mile were put on hold until after the exposition. However, coincidentally on the day of the exposition, the 2008 economic crisis hit, and one of the Digital Mile’s biggest investors, the Lehman brothers, went bankrupt, which halted a majority of their development. Since then, the Digital Mile as a project is no longer active, however it has been broken down into mini projects that are happening around the city. 

## Key Characteristics

<!--  Summarize the most visible essential characteristics of the project. For districts: How does the district employ 3-5 of the key characteristics of New Century Cities? For plans: How does the plan address each of the three activities (development, engagement, implementation) of the digital masterplanning process described in the 2015 Townsend and Lorimer paper?
-->

**Etopia Center for Arts and Technology**. The Etopia Center for Arts and Technology was designed to be an expressive building merging research, art, economics, communication, culture, and technology in the city. Spanning 16,000 square meters, with three large sections, it acts as an open space for where artists, engineers, and the general public can come together. Additionally, it connects Zaragoza to the former international exposition grounds, as well as the high-speed railway station and a surrounding park. Its role is really to act as a place for the community to gather and share knowledge, as well as a technological and innovation hub. It does so by housing two startup incubators, a residence for creators and researchers, audiovisual and technological creative laboratories, as well as university research. 

**Bridge Pavilion by Zaha Hadid**.  The Zaha Hadid Bridge Pavilion connects one of the main neighborhoods of Zaragoza, La Almozara, to the exposition site, and spans the Ebro river. The walls are made of digitally controlled water droplets, which can generate writing or patterns or access to spaces. The result is a space that is interactive and reconfigurable in that each wall can potentially become an entrance or exit, while the internal parts can shift depending on the number of people present. At the end of the bridge at the entrance of the expo site, there is the digital water pavilion by Carlo Ratti, which all come together to act as an interactive exhibition area focusing on water sustainability, as well as a public event space with many digital elements. 

**Paseo del Agua**.  The last key characteristic I will discuss is one that was included in the initial proposal, but has yet to be implemented- the Paseo del Agua, or Water Wall. The Paseo del Agua would act as an interactive fountain where people could digitally control the streams of water. With a command – for example by jumping into the water or sending a message through their phone – the water could start and stop or change in pressure. This is a significant urban element, similar to a canal running through the city, except twisted into a vertical plane so that people can experience it from a distance as a landmark or interact with it directly. Anchored between the two significant event places Almozara and Portillo, it would work with the bridges and event spaces to knit together the Digital Mile and act as a tool to facilitate flow in the community. The Paseo del Agua would act as a place for the community to gather and enjoy the natural resources, while learning more about sustainability and the environment.

## Financing
<!--  Identify at least one financing scheme being used in this project or plan. About 100 words is probably a good length for this. --->

**Financing Scheme**. 
These project are being funded both publicly and privately. On the public front, one of the biggest stakeholders in the project, City Hall, is providing a large bulk of the financial support. There is also the main bank of the region, and they are the main private contributor to the project. They also work with the Fundacion Zaragoza Ciudad del Conocimiento, which my interviewee was the founder of, to get competitive funding for proposals. They mainly work with European municipalities to get funding, as well as recovery funds. Lastly, they also received a small amount of funding from the University, as a result of an agreement where they would manage the research labs and citizens science projects that would be integrated into the Etopia Center. 

## Outcomes
<!--- Identify 3-5 (anticipated) outcomes. What will/has the project achieved? Thes should not be the same or repeated from elsewhere. Use this space to emphasize something different. About 50 words per is minimum, but these can be as long as you want/need. --->

## Open Questions
<!--- Identify 1-3 open question(s). What is uncertain, unclear, or still unresolved about this project? These can be 50 words or less. --->

**Open questions 1**. Despite the numerous technological interventions and proposals, the Digital Mile project and plans that followed have yet to explore the topic of sustainability. What are ways the city could look into tapping into their potential for renewable energy systems?

**Open questions 2**. In my interview, Daniel Sarasa Funes discussed how there seemed to be a disconnect between the public and the urban development. Many people didn't quite understand the significance of what was being developed, nor did they understand how the communities would benefit, or why they were necessary. With regional elections coming up, what should politicians do to create a new narrative to garner more public support for further urban regeneration projects?
